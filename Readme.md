## About

Advent of Code is a fantastic opportunity to:
- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills
- Experiment with different programming languages
- Collaborate and compete with others in the coding community

In this repo, you'll find my solutions organized by day. Each solution includes the problem statement and my code for solving it.
